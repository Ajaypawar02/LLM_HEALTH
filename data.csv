1455,Keto Chocolate Hazelnut Muffins,,"<p>Hazelnuts have a lot of health benefits. Like most nuts, hazelnuts are a good source of monounsaturated fats, which are good for your heart.</p>

<p>They also pack in a good amount of vitamin E, B vitamins, folate, potassium, calcium and magnesium. These valuable nutrients are tough to find in our modern diet, which has strayed pretty far away from its natural origins.</p>

<p>Hazelnuts also have more proanthocyanidins than other nuts. This compound may reduce your risk of urinary tract infections and blood clotting.</p>

<p>While you may not be familiar with proanthocyanidins, here&rsquo;s one you probably are familiar with: fiber. Hazelnuts are a good source of fiber, which helps digestion and makes you feel full.</p>
